# DECISIONS

Small choices made where the specs were ambiguous, per the working agreement in
CLAUDE.md. Each entry names the ambiguity, the choice, and why.

## Open, blocked on owner

### D-009. The exemplar contains no LaTeX, but the generator is told to emit only LaTeX

**Status: OPEN. Needs a decision before Phase 1 generation is trusted.**

Same shape as D-001, found while verifying Phase 0. The exemplar contains
**zero** `$` or `$$` math delimiters. All twenty of its formulas are markdown
code spans: `` `d = rt` ``, `` `1.2(r + 35)` ``, `` `(t - 2)` ``.

Against that:

| Source | Rule |
|---|---|
| CLAUDE.md locked decisions | KaTeX "renders all generated LaTeX" |
| docs/02 | "Stored content is markdown with `$`/`$$` math" |
| docs/03 | `contentMd` is "full markdown, math as `$...$`/`$$...$$`" |
| docs/05 §2.1 | "All math in LaTeX delimited by `$` or `$$`" |

This does **not** block Phase 0. Non-negotiable 5 forbids raw math "outside of
a code context", and code spans are exactly a code context, so the exemplar
renders correctly and legibly as-is (verified: 9 tables, 6 model anchors, 0
KaTeX errors, 0 stray `$`).

It does put Phase 1 at risk, for the same reason as D-001: the generator is
*told* to use LaTeX while being *shown* 3,343 words that never do. Expect
generated docs to imitate the exemplar and emit code-span math, which renders
as monospace rather than typeset math.

Options:

- **(a) Counter-instruction only.** Add a line to the generator prompt: "The
  exemplar writes math as code spans. You must not: use `$...$` and `$$...$$`."
  Cheapest, consistent with the D-001 resolution, but leaves the strongest
  signal in the prompt pulling the wrong way.
- **(b) Convert math in the injected copy.** Extend the D-001 prompt-only
  normalization to also rewrite code-span math into `$...$`. Makes example and
  instruction agree. Risk: a mechanical converter can mangle a span that is not
  actually math.
- **(c) Accept code spans as the house format.** Drop the LaTeX requirement
  from docs/05 §2.1 and lean on KaTeX only where a generated doc chooses `$`.
  Contradicts the KaTeX locked decision.

Recommendation: **(a)**, and inspect the first generated doc. If it comes back
with code-span math anyway, escalate to (b).

## Resolved

### D-001. The exemplar contains em-dashes that the spec forbids

**Status: RESOLVED 2026-08-21. Owner chose (a) + (b) together.**

Agreed approach: the exemplar stays byte-identical on disk and is seeded as-is;
validation applies to generated docs only; the copy injected into the generator
prompt gets its em-dashes stripped; and the prompt carries an explicit
counter-instruction.

**Done in Phase 0:** the heading parser (`src/lib/modelIndex.ts`) accepts `-`,
`–`, `—` and `:`, which is what makes the seed find all six models (verified:
`#model-1` through `#model-6` all present and `#model-3` scrolling correctly).

**Still to build in Phase 1:** the prompt-only em-dash stripping and the
counter-instruction, both of which live in `src/lib/ai/prompts.ts`, which does
not exist yet.

`content/exemplars/drt-mental-models.md` contains 31 em-dash characters,
including in all six model headings (`## Model 1 — A rate is an exchange rate,
not a measurement`).

This collides with four other rules:

| Source | Rule |
|---|---|
| CLAUDE.md non-negotiable 6 | No em-dashes in user-facing copy or generated docs |
| docs/05 §2.3 | Reject and retry a generated doc that "contains an em-dash character" |
| docs/05 §1 | The exemplar is injected **in full** as the generation few-shot |
| docs/03 | Parse `modelIndexJson` from `## Model N - Title` headings (hyphen) |
| CLAUDE.md read order | "Never edit it" |

Two concrete problems:

1. **Prompt contradiction.** The generator is shown a 3,343-word exemplar with 31
   em-dashes and simultaneously told to use none. The strongest signal in the
   prompt is the example. Expect generated docs to carry em-dashes, fail
   validation, retry, and fail again, burning two generator calls per attempt.
2. **Parser mismatch.** A heading parser written to the letter of docs/03 (`- `)
   finds zero models in the exemplar, so the seed writes an empty
   `modelIndexJson` and every diagnosis deep-link breaks.

Options, for the owner to choose:

- **(a) Grandfather the exemplar.** Keep the file byte-identical. Validation
  applies to generated docs only. Add an explicit line to the generator system
  prompt: "The exemplar below uses em-dashes; you must not. Use commas, colons,
  parentheses, or hyphens instead." Parser accepts `-`, `–`, `—`.
- **(b) Normalize a prompt-only copy.** Keep the file on disk untouched and
  seeded as-is, but strip em-dashes from the copy injected into the prompt.
  Removes the contradiction at its source; the injected text then differs from
  the stored doc.
- **(c) Relax the rule.** Drop the em-dash clause from validation and from
  non-negotiable 6, accepting em-dashes throughout.
- **(d) Edit the exemplar.** Overrides "never edit it".

No option is implemented yet. Nothing about this is safe to guess: it changes
the few-shot that sets the quality bar for every generated document.

## Resolved

### D-002. Session scope

Phases 0 and 1 only, decided with the owner on 2026-08-21 via the brainstorming
visual companion. Phases 2 through 5 are out of scope for this session.

### D-003. Baseline commit contents

The handoff bundle (CLAUDE.md, docs/, brand/, content/) was copied in and
committed as `baaa774` before any application code, so the spec is a fixed point
in history and later diffs show only what was built.

### D-004. `.gitignore` covers `.superpowers/`

The brainstorming companion writes mockups into `.superpowers/brainstorm/`.
Ignored rather than committed: it is session scratch, not project source.

### D-005. OpenAI model IDs

Checked OpenAI's model documentation on 2026-08-21.

| Constant | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `GENERATOR` | `gpt-5.6-sol` | Frontier reasoning model. CLAUDE.md: math correctness is the product, so this does not get a cheaper tier. |
| `VERIFIER` | `gpt-5.6-sol` | Must be at least as strong as the generator, or verification rubber-stamps the generator's own errors. |
| `CLASSIFIER` | `gpt-5.6-luna` | Cheapest tier. Taxonomy filing is a small bounded mapping task. |
| `OCR` | `gpt-5.6-terra` | Needs image input; Terra balances capability and cost. Revisit in Phase 4 if handwriting accuracy disappoints, since a bad transcription feeds a bad diagnosis. |

### D-006. Zod 4 native JSON Schema instead of `zod-to-json-schema`

docs/05 §8 names the `zod-to-json-schema` package. Zod 4 ships
`z.toJSONSchema()` natively and emits exactly what OpenAI strict mode needs
(every property in `required`, `additionalProperties: false`). Same
single-source property the spec is actually asking for, one fewer dependency.

### D-007. Tailwind v4 configures in CSS, not `tailwind.config.js`

docs/08 says to mirror the tokens "in the Tailwind config". Tailwind v4 has no
JS config by default: the `@theme` block in `globals.css` **is** the config, and
each `--color-*` token there generates `bg-*` / `text-*` / `border-*` utilities.
Tokens are therefore defined exactly once, which is what the doc is after.

### D-008. A topic holding one document opens that document directly

docs/06 §2 describes "topic selected, no doc selected" as a card list, but Phase
0 acceptance criterion 2 says "opening Distance-Rate-Time shows the exemplar doc
fully rendered". With one document a one-card list is a pointless extra click,
so a single document opens directly; two or more still show the card list.

### D-010. `.env` is committed, `.env.local` is not

Phase 0 acceptance criterion 1 requires a fresh clone to work "with only
`OPENAI_API_KEY` set", which means `DATABASE_URL` has to ship with the repo.
`.env` holds only the local SQLite path and no secret, so it is committed. The
key lives in `.env.local`, which stays ignored (non-negotiable 1).

### D-011. Prisma CLI advisory left in place

`npm audit` reports a high-severity stack-exhaustion advisory in `deepmerge-ts`,
reached only through `@prisma/config`, which is the Prisma **CLI's** config
loader. It is not in the runtime client and never sees user input. The offered
fix downgrades Prisma to 6.12.0, a breaking change, to harden a path that parses
our own config file. Left as-is and recorded rather than silently accepted.

### D-012. Learn routes are explicitly dynamic

Next 16 prerendered `/learn` and the Learn layout as static because they read
the database at build. That would freeze the topic tree and document list at
build time, so Phase 1's generated documents would never appear. Both carry
`export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`, matching docs/04 ("all these routes
are dynamic").

### D-013. Next 16's CLAUDE.md auto-append is disabled

`next dev` writes a `nextjs-agent-rules` block into CLAUDE.md on every run and
re-adds it if deleted. CLAUDE.md is this project's source of truth, handed over
with the spec bundle, so a build tool editing it is not acceptable: it would
either churn the working tree every session or quietly grow the spec file.
`agentRules: false` in `next.config.ts` turns it off.

The block's actual advice is worth keeping in mind though, so it is recorded
here instead: **Next 16 has breaking changes from earlier versions, and the
authoritative docs ship in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`.** Check there before
writing Next-specific code rather than relying on recall.
