# DECISIONS

Small choices made where the specs were ambiguous, per the working agreement in
CLAUDE.md. Each entry names the ambiguity, the choice, and why.

## Open, blocked on owner

### D-001. The exemplar contains em-dashes that the spec forbids

**Status: OPEN. Needs Natalie's decision before Phase 1.**

`content/exemplars/drt-mental-models.md` contains 31 em-dash characters,
including in all six model headings (`## Model 1 — A rate is an exchange rate,
not a measurement`).

This collides with four other rules:

| Source | Rule |
|---|---|
| CLAUDE.md non-negotiable 6 | No em-dashes in user-facing copy or generated docs |
| docs/05 §2.3 | Reject and retry a generated doc that "contains an em-dash character" |
| docs/05 §1 | The exemplar is injected **in full** as the generation few-shot |
| docs/03 | Parse `modelIndexJson` from `## Model N - Title` headings (hyphen) |
| CLAUDE.md read order | "Never edit it" |

Two concrete problems:

1. **Prompt contradiction.** The generator is shown a 3,343-word exemplar with 31
   em-dashes and simultaneously told to use none. The strongest signal in the
   prompt is the example. Expect generated docs to carry em-dashes, fail
   validation, retry, and fail again, burning two generator calls per attempt.
2. **Parser mismatch.** A heading parser written to the letter of docs/03 (`- `)
   finds zero models in the exemplar, so the seed writes an empty
   `modelIndexJson` and every diagnosis deep-link breaks.

Options, for the owner to choose:

- **(a) Grandfather the exemplar.** Keep the file byte-identical. Validation
  applies to generated docs only. Add an explicit line to the generator system
  prompt: "The exemplar below uses em-dashes; you must not. Use commas, colons,
  parentheses, or hyphens instead." Parser accepts `-`, `–`, `—`.
- **(b) Normalize a prompt-only copy.** Keep the file on disk untouched and
  seeded as-is, but strip em-dashes from the copy injected into the prompt.
  Removes the contradiction at its source; the injected text then differs from
  the stored doc.
- **(c) Relax the rule.** Drop the em-dash clause from validation and from
  non-negotiable 6, accepting em-dashes throughout.
- **(d) Edit the exemplar.** Overrides "never edit it".

No option is implemented yet. Nothing about this is safe to guess: it changes
the few-shot that sets the quality bar for every generated document.

## Resolved

### D-002. Session scope

Phases 0 and 1 only, decided with the owner on 2026-08-21 via the brainstorming
visual companion. Phases 2 through 5 are out of scope for this session.

### D-003. Baseline commit contents

The handoff bundle (CLAUDE.md, docs/, brand/, content/) was copied in and
committed as `baaa774` before any application code, so the spec is a fixed point
in history and later diffs show only what was built.

### D-004. `.gitignore` covers `.superpowers/`

The brainstorming companion writes mockups into `.superpowers/brainstorm/`.
Ignored rather than committed: it is session scratch, not project source.
